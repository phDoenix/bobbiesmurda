This was supposed to be update 0.2.1; a minor upgrade/QoL update involving a revamp of all the modpack's config files.
However, after going a bit overboard with experimentation I've decided to just release this as the 0.3 update, 
focusing on overhauling the visuals of some blocks, adding immersive particle effects and filling in some QoL inconsistencies.
I hope you enjoy the update!
