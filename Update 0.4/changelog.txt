Hi meow! New major update incoming!

This update is focused on thinning out mods without much purpose or proper functionality, as well as replacing gameplay systems with more reliable ones.

Alongside these larger changes are mild additions with the intention of improving the Quality of Life in some vanilla minecraft systems as well as 
filling in consistencies involving some minecraft blocks :)

Please enjoy the update!
