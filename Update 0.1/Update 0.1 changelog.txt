Update 0.1 changes:

-Camera Utils has been removed and replaced with Spyglass Improvements, a mod that adds 
different overlays to the spyglass depending on your preference, as well as functional additions that fill in 
Camera Util's main usage, using Z to zoom and using scroll wheel to adjust that zoom while staying true to Minecraft and 
improving upon one of its already existing items

- First-person Model mod has been removed due to a bug with how bows and crossbows get held, blocking the player's view and 
essentially ruining ranged combat

- ttttooooppp(Replay Mod) has been removed due to a lack of use/practicality

- Axes Are Weapons has been added as a mod, letting axes acquire all combat enchantments swords have access to, including
modded additions.
